# Task instruction:
You are an offensive speech detection program, your task is to analyze a given text to determine if it could be offensive to anyone. 
Your decision should be explained step by step.

# Offensive examples:
# Example 1:
Post: What does the Holocaust and my orgasms have in common? They were both faked
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: yes
Explanation: The given text suggests that the Holocaust was fabricated or exaggerated, which can be deeply offensive to those affected by the Holocaust, such as descendants of survivors or people connected to the Jewish community.

# Example 2:
Post: What's the first thing a woman does when she comes home from the Battered Women's shelter? The dishes, if she knows what's good for her.
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: yes
Explanation: The given text makes light of domestic violence and can be considered misogynistic. It suggests that women who have experienced domestic abuse should listen to their abusers and do what they say, to avoid further violence. This could be considered offensive by women and survivors of domestic abuse.

# Example 3:
Post: The Jews who govern us in Europe and America have been censoring nationalist and alt-right ideas for years now – with an extreme uptick in purges and political arrests in countries like Germany – and nobody says anything!
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: yes
Explanation: The text suggests that Jewish people are in control of the government and are censoring certain political ideas. This is a common anti-Semitic trope and can be considered offensive to Jewish people or people connected to the Jewish community.

# Example 4:
Post: Whats worse than a dead homosexual? A live one.
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: yes
Explanation: The text suggests that it is worse for homosexuals to be alive than dead, which could be deeply offensive to members of the LGBT+ community, specifically homosexuals.

# Example 5:
Post: Diversity and immigration = allowing enemies into our cities.
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: yes
Explanation: The text suggests that all immigrants are enemies, which is an offensive and unfair generalization. It assumes that anyone who immigrates to a city or country is automatically an enemy, which is not only inaccurate but also promotes a negative and harmful stereotype.

# Example 6:
Post: Wealthy white Dems sending out vacation pics from the protected resorts they go to is how they stand with the poor people they exploit around the world.. apparently.
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: yes
Explanation: The sentence specifically targets white individuals, suggesting that their wealth and political affiliation make them exploitative of poor people. This can be offensive to white people, and perpetuate racial biases and reinforce negative stereotypes.

# Example 7: 
Post: When they sent n iggers to space the space ships started blowing up .
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: yes
Explanation: The post uses the n-word, which is widely recognized as an extremely offensive term that has been historically used to demean, dehumanize, and discriminate against black people.
Furthermore, the post suggests that the presence of black people in spaceships lead to explosions, which can be considered offensive to black people.

# Non-offensive examples:
# Example 1:
Post: Why hasn't Trump deported all the Muslims yet? Because he can't get them past airport security.
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: no
Explanation: The post is a joke about airport security disproportionally targeting Muslims for security checks. It is not offensive to Muslims, but rather highlights the racial profiling that they face.

# Example 2: 
Post: i know this a horrible, racist, nazi sorta thing to say, but i'm just gonna say it: White People should have the same rights as everybody else in America
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: no
Explanation: The post is ironically claiming to be racist, potentially hoping to elicit a reaction from the reader. However, the post is not actually racist, as it is advocating for equal rights for white people, which is not a racist belief, and is not offensive to anyone.

# Example 3: 
Post: i'm so stupid i washed my hair and noticed it was all knotty and nasty and i realized i washed it with fucking soap
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: no
Explanation: The post is about washing hair using soap instead of shampoo and does not contain any offensive statements or opinions.

# Example 4: 
Post: ready to fucking kill myself because of a UTI!! why must I always get them!! they're so awful
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: no
Explanation: The post expresses a strong emotional reaction to experiencing a urinary tract infection and the frustration of recurrent episodes. While the language used in the post contains a swear word, it is a reflection of the poster's distress and the intensity of their feelings rather than being offensive towards others. 

# Example 5: 
Post: A new study has linked ibuprofen to male infertility, so I would recommend never taking any products containing ibuprofen ever again.
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: no
Explanation: The recommendation of the author of this post is based on a scientific finding of a link between ibuprofen and male infertility, and is not inherently offensive.

# Example 6: 
Post: What's a klansman's favorite type of cheese? White American
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: no
Explanation: The post plays on the irony of Klansmen supporting the concept of white racial superiority while making a humorous connection to the type of cheese they might prefer. The term "White American" refers both to their preferred cheese and the racial ideology they promote. The post is not directly offensive to anyone.

# Example 7:
Post: 20 minutes on the phone with Office 365 support in India to get an account unlocked. Now they're escalating it. It's one fucking checkbox.
Choice: yes
Choice: no
Answer: no
