BASELINE_PROMPT = """As an AI language model, your task is to analyze a given text sentence to determine if it contains hate speech. You must consider factors such as context, tone, and word choice when evaluating the sentence. After careful analysis, provide a response of "yes," "maybe," or "no" to indicate the level of certainty that the sentence contains hate speech. It is crucial that you only return one of these three options and nothing else. Keep in mind that these evaluations can be subjective, and your assessment should be based on the best understanding of the text provided. Do not provide any explanation for your choice."""
